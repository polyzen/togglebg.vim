		Toggle Background Plugin by Ethan Schoonover ~

Toggle Background					*toggle-bg* *togglebg*
							*toggle-background*

A simple plugin to switch between light and dark background modes and reset the
colorscheme. This is most useful for colorschemes that support both light and
dark modes and in terminals or GUI Vim windows where the background will be
properly set.

Toggle Background can be accessed by:

    * the Window menu (in Vim GUI mode)
    * the "yin/yang" toolbar button (in Vim GUI mode)
    * the default mapping of <F5>
    * custom key mapping you set in your .vimrc (see below)
    * command line via ":ToggleBG" (no quotes)

Toggle Background starts with a default mapping to function key <F5>. If you 
are already using this in a mapping, Toggle Background will not map itself to 
a default and you will have to map it manually in your .vimrc file, or 
remove/change your existing <F5> mapping to another value. To customize the 
keyboard mapping in your .vimrc file, use the following line, changing the 
'<F5>' value to the key or key combination you wish to use:

	call togglebg#map('<F5>')

Note that you'll want to use a single function key or equivalent if you want 
the plugin to work in all modes (normal, insert, visual).

When using the plugin during normal, visual, or insert mode, there should be 
no interruption in workflow. However, if you activate the plugin during 
REPLACE mode, you will switch to standard insert mode (you will leave the 
overwrite replace mode).
