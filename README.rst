Toggle Background
=================

A simple plugin to switch between light and dark background modes and reset the
colorscheme. This is most useful for colorschemes that support both light and
dark modes and in terminals or GUI Vim windows where the background will be
properly set.

`For the time being`__, the script must be called from your vimrc like so:
``call togglebg#map('<F5>')``.

See `:help togglebg`__ for more details.
